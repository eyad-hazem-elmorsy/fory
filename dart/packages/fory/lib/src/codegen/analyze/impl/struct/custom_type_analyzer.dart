   Here is an explanation
   Why, when this class is a custom type,
   it simply retrieves without checking validity or caching the analysis results for possible future operations.
   First, if this class has annotations, it will naturally trigger a dedicated analysis. If there is an error in the writing, it will naturally report it, so why not let it handle it there.
   Additionally, for now, annotations are simple and it seems possible to analyze everything at once, but in the future, as fields may gradually increase, handling it here would be overstepping, so it is not cached now.
